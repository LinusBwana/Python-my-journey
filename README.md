# Python-my-journey
This repository documents my personal journey in learning Python from the basics to more advanced concepts. It includes organized folders for each topic, practical examples, notes, and challenges I've worked on along the way. The goal is to reinforce my understanding and share my progress as I grow from beginner to proficient Python developer.

**This repo has:**

Topic-based folders (e.g., variables, loops, functions, OOP, file handling, etc.)

Well-commented Python scripts

Notes and explanations in README files

Hands-on coding challenges

Continuous updates as I learn more
