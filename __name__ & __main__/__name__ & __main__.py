# __name__ & __main__: (This script can be imported or run standalone)
# functions and classes in this module can be reused without the main block of code executing
# Good practice: - code is modular
#                  helps in readability
#                  leaves no global variables
#                  avoids an intended execution
# e.g library - import a library for functionality
#               when running a library directly, display the help page
