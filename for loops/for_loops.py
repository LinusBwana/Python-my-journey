# for loops execute a block of code a fixed number of times
# You can iterate over a range, string, sequence etc


# example 1
# for x in range(1, 11):
#     print(x)
# print("HAPPY NEW YEAR")

# example 2
# for x in reversed(range(1, 11)):
#     print(x)
# print("HAPPY NEW YEAR")

# example 3
# for x in range(1, 11, 2):
#     print(x)
# print("HAPPY NEW YEAR")

# example 4
credit_card = "1234-5678-9012-3456"
for x in credit_card:
    print(x)
